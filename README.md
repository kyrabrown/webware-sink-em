## CS4241 Final Assignment -- Battleship - Sink 'Em

https://webware-sink-em.onrender.com/

Our group created a battleship game named Sink 'Em. It includes a create/join game feature for two players to play together, a placement phase where players decide where to place their ships on a grid, and a firing phase where players guess where their opponent's ship might be.

The create game feature creates a game code the join game accepts, and both pages generate a name for the player. The placement stage gives players 5 ships to place anywhere on the board, and allows them to rotate them both horizontally and vertically. The firing stage allows players to select a square to guess, submit when ready, and lets the player know if the guess was a hit or miss. While waiting for your turn, the player can see the hits and misses of their opponent. Everything is brought together with visuals via Tailwind.

## Technologies Used:

- **Express + Vite** : We used Express and Vite to build the server to communicate with the client.
- **React** : We used React to build the app, including the client side and display (i.e. buttons, grid, etc).
- **WebSocket** : We used WebSockets to allow players to play together simultaneously.
- **MongoDB** : We used Mongo to store game data (particularly for game IDs)
- **Tailwind** : We used Tailwind to style our app.
